I am a 16 year old high school student from Southern California, and I like to (attempt to) code for fun. I've never actually been that good at it, especially considering my bad memory forcing me to constantly go back and double-check whether what I've written is correct. I've been coding since I was 14, but fell out of it for two years and started getting back into it at 16/January 2025. I'm only actually good at CSS and HTML, and am struggling to learn JavaScript. I'd like to learn C# and Java once I believe that I am ready for it.

- I’m currently working on my website, { [removed js in case cuz my acc is flagged] }. I made it in June-ish of 2024, but didn't really start actually working on it til Dec '24 or Jan '25. I also purchased the domain { [same as above] } but haven't actually done anything with it yet. I should probably quit paying for that, actually.
- I’m currently attempting to learn HTML & CSS more fluently so I won't have to constantly check on my own writing. I'd also like to eventually learn JavaScript better, since I usually ask for help from friends when it comes to scripting.
- If I built up the courage to actually ask for help for once, I'd like help with actually fully wrapping my head around how coding actually really works, if that makes sense? Like, I get it, but I don't think I truly understand it.

- My pronouns are exclusively he/him. I don't really have a gender, or at least one that makes sense to most people.
- My main hobbies are coding, art, and music, both listening to and performing. Coding is really more of a side thing that I do mostly for fun, although if I do end up going to school for something after high school, I'd love for it to be something relating to the computer sciences, preferably with math/engineering involved as well. I love math.
- I used to be smart. While I'm not very smart anymore, I'm still a nerd, and a proud one at that. Being a nerd is freaking awesome.
